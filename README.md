## Documentation



### Getting Started With ML Project With MLFLOW

- Installing MLflow.

- Starting a local MLflow Tracking Server.

- Logging and registering a model with MLflow.

- Loading a logged model for inference using MLflowâ€™s pyfunc flavor.

- Viewing the experiment results in the MLflow UI.


### Model Registry

The MLflow Model Registry component is a centralized model store, set of APIs, and UI, to collaboratively manage the full lifecycle of an MLflow Model. It provides model lineage (which MLflow experiment and run produced the model), model versioning, model aliasing, model tagging, and annotations.
