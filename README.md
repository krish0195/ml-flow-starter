ML PROJECT INTEGRATION WITH MLFLOW Tracking


### 1)Getting Started With ML Project With MLFLOW

- Installing MLflow.

- Starting a local MLflow Tracking Server.

- Logging and registering a model with MLflow.

- Loading a logged model for inference using MLflowâ€™s pyfunc flavor.

- Viewing the experiment results in the MLflow UI.


### Model Registry

The MLflow Model Registry component is a centralized model store, set of APIs, and UI, to collaboratively manage the full lifecycle of an MLflow Model. It provides model lineage (which MLflow experiment and run produced the model), model versioning, model aliasing, model tagging, and annotations.

## House Price Prediction With MLFLOW
 

- Run a hyperparameter tuning while training a model
- Log every Hyperparameter and metrics in the MLFLOW UI 

- Compare the results of the various runs in the MLflow UI

- Choose the best run and register it as a model



DEEP LEARNING ANN MODEL BUILDING INTEGRATION WITH MLFLOW 

### Quickstart: Compare runs, choose a model, and deploy it to a REST API


- Run a hyperparameter sweep on a training script

- Compare the results of the runs in the MLflow UI

- Choose the best run and register it as a model

- Deploy the model to a REST API

- Build a container image suitable for deployment to a cloud platform
